To clean all temporary and cache data on Windows using BleachBit via the command line, you can use the following steps:

1. Open the Command Prompt with administrative privileges.
2. Navigate to the directory where BleachBit is installed. For example:
   ```cmd
   cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\BleachBit"
   ```
3. Use the `bleachbit_console.exe` command with the appropriate options. For cleaning all temporary and cache data, you can use:
   ```cmd
   bleachbit_console.exe --clean system.tmp system.cache
   ```

You can also list all available cleaning options with:
```cmd
bleachbit_console.exe --list
```

Make sure to preview the changes before cleaning to avoid accidental deletion of important files:
```cmd
bleachbit_console.exe --preview system.tmp system.cache
```
